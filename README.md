# Stock Market Prediction Using Recurrent Neural Networks

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop and implement a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model capable of predicting future stock prices based on historical data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of historical price data for Bitcoin, Binance, and Ethereum, sourced from Yahoo Finance. This data includes key financial metrics such as opening prices, closing prices, high and low prices, and trading volumes, which are essential for training the RNN model to predict future cryptocurrency prices.

## Overview 

Stock market prediction is a crucial tool in the financial industry, enabling investors and analysts to make informed decisions by anticipating future price movements. This project utilises a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), a type of deep learning model that excels at analysing time-series data to predict Bitcoin, Binance, and Ethereum stock prices. By capturing the temporal patterns in stock prices, the RNN model aims to provide accurate predictions, offering insights that can enhance trading strategies and risk management. The project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in financial forecasting, bridging the gap between data-driven analysis and market trends.
